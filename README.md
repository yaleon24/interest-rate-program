# interest-rate-program
Write a program that takes two numbers from the Java console representing, respectively, an investment and an interest rate (you will expect the user to enter a number such as .065 for the interest rate, representing a 6.5% interest rate.)  Do not prompt anything from the user before reading in the investment and interest rate.  Your program should calculate and output (in $ notation) the future value of the investment in 5, 10, 15 and 20 years using the following formula:  future value = investment * (1 + interest rate)^year  We will assume the interest rate is an annual rate and is compounded annually.  Use NumberFormat to output the $:  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/text/NumberFormatter.html  Only display the output like this:  Year 5: $31,907.04 Year 10: $40,722.37 Year 15: $51,973.20 Year 20: $66,332.44  substituting the correct amount for the value of the investment after the given period.  The program must ignore any input other than decimal numbers.  Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);  while(!s.hasNextDouble()) s.next();  Lastly, don't forget to take out the package when you submit to mimir.  Pay attention to the spacing in the output
